How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    This will allow me to what changes have happened, and change those that were just typos.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    There is always a need to go back to previous versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    could take a litte more time, but you will also have a running history

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    We could elimate the compare, and only look at the source files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    the log will show when changes were made to the file, the diff will show the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to a previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control
